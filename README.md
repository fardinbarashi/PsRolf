# PsRolf
PsRolf  is a script designed to automatically remove user accounts that have not been logged in for a specified number of days, by default set to 180 days. To modify the time threshold, you can adjust the value of the $DaysFilterAccounts variable by changing the "-180" value to your desired number of days. When the script runs, it will remove the registry keys associated with the profile and home folder for each expired account, effectively deleting the account and associated data from the system. This automated process can help to maintain system performance and security by reducing clutter and minimizing the risk of unauthorized access through unused accounts.
